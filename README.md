### Common Issues

1. **Cannot access from other devices:**

   - Ensure the server is running and accessible on your network
   - Check firewall settings on the host machine
   - Verify devices are on the same network (or use proper port forwarding)
   - Docker exposes port 4242 by default (maps to internal port 3000)

2. **Database errors:**

   - Check file permissions in the `data/` directory
   - Verify the database file isn't corrupted (restore from backup)

3. **Performance on Raspberry Pi or low-spec devices:**

   - Use Raspberry Pi 3 or newer for best performance
   - Use a fast SD card (Class 10 or better) or USB SSD
   - Monitor CPU and memory usage with `htop`
   - Consider limiting concurrent sessions

4. **Session issues:**

   - Clear browser cookies if experiencing login problems
   - Revoke old sessions from user settings if needed

### Performance Optimization

```bash
# Monitor system resources
htop

# Check Docker container logs
docker logs <container_name>
```

## Deployment Options

### Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy with Docker Compose (see Quick Start section above).

### Raspberry Pi

The application runs well on Raspberry Pi 4 or newer:

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose on your Pi
2. Follow the Docker setup instructions
3. Use a quality SD card or USB SSD for better performance
4. Consider setting up automatic backups

### VPS/Cloud Server

Deploy on any VPS or cloud provider:

1. Install Docker or Bun runtime
2. Clone the repository
3. Configure environment variables
4. Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) for HTTPS
5. Set up automatic backups and monitoring

### Custom Domain with HTTPS

For secure external access:

**Option 1: Cloudflare (Easiest)**

- Create a cloudflare tunnel at server and point it to your domain at cloudflare

**Option 2: Let's Encrypt + nginx**

```bash
# Example nginx reverse proxy configuration
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4242;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```
