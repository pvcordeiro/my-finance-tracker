## Quick Start (Docker)

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed

### 1. Clone/download this repo

### 2. Copy `.env.example` into `.env` file and change your admin credentials, secrets, etc:

```
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword
SESSION_SECRET=yourrandomsecret
# DATABASE_URL, DOMAIN, etc. can also be set if needed
```

### 3. Start everything with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or your server's IP).

The SQLite database will be created at `data/finance.db` on first run and persisted on your host.

### 4. (Optional) Nginx + HTTPS

Nginx is included in the Docker Compose setup for HTTPS/SSL termination. See the `nginx/` folder for configuration and instructions on using your own domain and certificates.

## Usage

### Authentication

- **User login:** Register or sign in with a username and password
- **Admin login:** Go to `/admin` for admin panel (credentials set at first deploy)
- **Registration:** Can be enabled/disabled by admin in the panel

### Multi-Device

- Access from any browser/device on your network
- All data is synced in real time

### Data & Backups

- **Database:** `data/finance.db` (SQLite, local only)
- **Export:** Download your data as JSON from the app
- **Backup:** Copy the `data/finance.db` file or use provided scripts

## Admin Panel

- Manage users (view, delete)
- Toggle registration (allow/disable new signups)
- View user activity
- Change admin password

### Common Issues

1. **Cannot access from other devices:**

   - Ensure the server is running on `0.0.0.0:3000`
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify devices are on the same network

2. **Database errors:**

   - Check file permissions in the `data/` directory
   - Ensure SQLite is properly installed

3. **Performance on Raspberry Pi:**
   - Use Raspberry Pi 4 for best performance
   - Consider using a fast SD card (Class 10 or better)
   - Monitor CPU and memory usage with `htop`

### Performance Optimization

```bash
# Increase Node.js memory limit if needed
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=512"

# Monitor system resources
htop
```
